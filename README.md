# wine_reviews_project

This directory features 3 documents summarizing the work and results of the capstone project for Springboard's Introduction
to Data Science course, titled "Leveraging Data to Choose Wine with Confidence." Using a raw dataset of wine reviews by experts
at Wine Enthusiast magazine, a model was created that predicts the value of a wine based on certain characteristics, such as
region of origin, price, variety, and vintage. R packages used include tidyr, dplyr, ggplot, stringr, and caret.
