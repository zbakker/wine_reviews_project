# Choosing a Wine Based on Reviews
### By ZoÃ« Bakker

## Intro
When deciding which wine to buy, one has to consider a number of factors:  
* Price  
* Wine type  
* Country of origin  
* Rating  
* And so on  

Choosing a wine can be a complicated process, but, for most people, the goal is to choose the best wine at the best price.

## Problem
Unless one is either a trained sommelier or has created some arbitrary rule for selecting wine   
_I'll just always buy the **second-cheapest** bottle of Chardonnay_, trying to select the best value wine can be stressful. 

I aim to make the process less stressful by creating a confidence-boosting program that can take away the guesswork in wine buying by accurately predicing wine value based on an analysis of a number of factors included in wine reviews.

##Clients  
* Wine buyers for restaurants, hotels, event spaces  
* Wine clubs, wine subscription services
* Professionals who buy client gifts meant to impress  
* Average consumers

## The Dataset  
Wine review will be pulled from:  
* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews)  
* [Global Wine Database](http://www.gwdb.io)  
* [Wine HQ](https://appdb.winehq.org)  

## The Approach  
1. Data Wrangling and Cleaning  
* Formatting the databases in the same manner so they can be combined  
* Dealing with NULL values  
* Re-formatting characters that were corrupted on download  

2. Exploratory Analysis  
* Perform regression analysis to determine which variables have the greatest impact on wine value  
* Identify patterns that connect different variables  

3. Prediction  
* Apply data science techniques to make predictions about wine based on a number of variables

##Deliverables  
* Presentation of findings  
* Summary of findings  
* R code
